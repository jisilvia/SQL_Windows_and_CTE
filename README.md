# SQL Window Functions and Common Table Expressions

A **window** function performs a calculation across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row. This is comparable to the type of calculation that can be done with an aggregate function.

A **CTE (Common Table Expression)** is a temporary result set that you can reference within another SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. 

## Project Description

This project uses the sakila database in combination with various window functions and CTEs to fulfill multiple data requests.

## Requirements

**SQL.** Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language that is typically used in relational database or data stream management systems.

**SQL Client Software.** A software package designed to define, manipulate, retrieve and manage data in a database, such as:
- [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/)
- [MySQL Worbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/).

**Web Host Service.** A web hosting service is a type of Internet hosting service that allows individuals and organizations to make their website accessible via the World Wide Web.
- [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/)

## Launch
Download the sakila database *sakila_data.sql* and import it to your SQL Client Software. Using your web host, create a new database for the downloaded files. Open the sakila schema file in your SQL client software and execute the code. Lastly, open the sakila data file in your SQL client software and execute the code to create the database.

Your SQL code is now ready to run.
